### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 My name is VÃ­tor Oliveira, I'm Software Developer,  passionate developer of innovative Native and BackEnd Cross-Platform technologies. I always seek to update myself in my knowledge and in new trends that seek to be innovative. My goal is always to work in a team where it is possible to help the team to grow and be able to evolve together. Knowledge, when shared, is (much) better used.
