### Hi there 👋

<p align="left">
 My name is Vítor Oliveira, I'm Software Developer with 5+ years experience. 
I'm passionate developer of innovative Native and BackEnd Cross-Platform technologies. I always seek to update myself in my knowledge and in new trends that seek to be innovative. My goal is always to work in a team where it is possible to help the team to grow and be able to evolve together. Knowledge, when shared, is (much) better used.

 💪🏼 My skills: C#, PHP, Typescript + NodeJS, Xamarin.Forms.
